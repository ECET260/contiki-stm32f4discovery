Some things to be done/checked yet:

- move stm32f4discovery examples to their own directory,
- build options (eg. WITH_SENSORS, WITH_ETH, WITH_ACCELEROMETER etc.). some of them will be mutually exclusive,
- IPv6,
- button sensor: value reset some time after button release, not after first sensor.value read, fix FIXME :)
- accelerometer sensor,
- usb otg,
- clean up arp cache every n minutes,
- rtimer arch dependent functions,
- mt arch dependent functions,
- uip arch dependent functions (is it necessary?),
- check why one Tx buffer results in all packets sent twice,
- 64-bit 10ms time counter + ntp client.
